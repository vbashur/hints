## Photogrametry tips

### Camera settings
 - lowest iso possible (100 or less)
 - high aperture (f/16 for full frame camera)

another option
  - exposure 1/160
  - aperture f/7.0
  - iso 800 (might be too high)

### Tooling

Spark AR - very nice AR effects but lots of restrictions: bound to meta products, not enough patches for hand tracking  
Unity3D - allows the advanced applications of AR features  
ARKit (from Apple) - looks perspective in a wave of hype around Vision Pro headset  
Cinema 4D from Apple   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh2LOEG9Zf8
