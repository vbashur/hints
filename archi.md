# basics of well architected-framework

well-architected framework - framework that help to tackle and prevent common cloud computing challenges
set of strategies and guidlines for designing and running workloads in the cloud  
it also provides a consistent approach to evaluate the architectures  
benefits of applying well-architected framework  
1) avoid common pitfalls
2) decrease a risk
3) make sure your application is well-architected

well-arcitectured framework (further WAF, see video from 'links' section) pillars  
* cost optimization
* operational excellence
* reliability
* performance efficiency
* security
* **AWS** (sustainability)
For each of those pillars we have 'disign principles'

To meporize easier use pattern - **C.O.R.P.S.**

### cost optimization
- avoid unnecessar costs
- using right type of resources
- cost efficient decisions

### operational excellence
running and monitoring systems to deliver business value and continuity
- perform operations as code
- make frequent small reversible changes
- refine operations procedures frequently (constant improvement)
- anticipate failure
  - identify possible failures before they occur
- learn from operational failures

   
### reliability
focus on the ability of a system to recover from disruptions, dynamically meed demand and mitigate disruptions
- automatically recover from failure
- test recovery procedures
- horizontally scale to increase aggregate workload availability
- stop guessing capacity
- manage change through automation
  

### performance efficiency
- use computing resources efficiently
- maintain the efficiency as changes occur
  
### security
- focus on protecting data, systems and assests
- condidentiality of the data
- identity and access management
- controls to detect security threats

### sustainability (AWS)
- minimizing environmental impact of running cloud workloads
