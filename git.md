Hints for GIT

This command will sync the local repository with the remote repository getting rid of every change you have made on your local\
`git reset --hard origin/<branch>`

Check outcoming commits (that haven't been pushed) at your local branch\
`git log @{u}..`


Whenever 'rebase' doesn't goes smooth\
`git rebase --abort`\
`rm -fr .git/rebase-merge`
